# PhpCallGraphGenerator
This is a C# winforms application for generating call graphs of PHP code.  I built it in order to better visualize some PHP code that I was working on.

The program parses through a folder (and all subfolders) of PHP, and then builds a graph based on the calls found.  The call graph is visualized using the GraphX library.
